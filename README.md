This my solution for Unit 8: Lab 1 "Countries Around The World" in the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD
### Objective: 
Javascript and DOM

### Task: 
In Javascript, Create a Country class and then an array of countries. In a separate function, prompt the user asking which country they’d like to display. Then recolor the DOM based on the Country selected. To start, make objects for at least 5 different countries.

### Starter Kit: 
https://github.com/TommyWaalkes/CountryColorsStarterKit

### Build Specifications: 
The Country class should contain the following properties: 
- Name 
- Official language 
- Hello World! In their language 
- Primary National Colors Array (Here’s a good list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_colours)

Each country should also have a method called Display colors, that using Javascript, will repaint the DOM to the color scheme of the selected country. You should also swap in: The Country’s name, their official language, and Hello World! In that language. (Google Translate ;) ) 

See the attached starter kit for the HTML/CSS.

Note: document.getElementById function will be your best friend when doing this lab.

### Extended Challenges: 
Add in an image, which when swapping countries will display the selected country’s flag. 
Instead of using a Prompt Function, create an html Drop-Down menu, that allows you to pick a country.
